The above tasks have also been completed in the WSL framework. The program has been modified to sum all the numbers from 1 to 10 which is shown in the screenshots.
All the same tasks have also ben done in the Github Codespace.

solutions to the questions
1. The programs are stored in the samples section of the riscv repository.

2. The program is compiled using g++ <program_name>.c . Output displayed using ./a.out

3.In a RISC-V core, memory fetching begins when the Program Counter (PC) provides the address of the next instruction. The Address Generation Unit calculates the effective address, which the system bus uses to retrieve data from RAM or Memory-Mapped I/O into CPU registers. It is meomory mapped IO .There are no unique "IN" or "OUT" instructions for I/O. The core treats a peripheral (like a UART or a Timer) as if it were just another location in memory.

4. It will be likely placed on the bus interconnect.
